Image Features and Homography
1. Given two images mountain1.jpg and mountain2.jpg, extract SIFT features and draw the
keypoints for both images. Include the resulting two images (task1 sift1.jpg, task1 sift2.jpg)
in the report. (1pt)
2. Match the keypoints using k-nearest neighbour (k=2), i.e., for a keypoint in the left image,
nding the best 2 matches in the right image. Filter good matches satisfy m.distance <
0.75 n.distance, where m is the rst match and n is the second match. Draw the match
image using cv2.drawMatches for all matches (your match image should contain both inliers
and outliers). Include the result image (task1 matches knn.jpg) in the report. (1pt)
3. Compute the homography matrix H (with RANSAC) from the rst image to the second
image. Include the matrix values in the report. (1pt)
4. Draw the match image for around 10 random matches using only inliers. Include the result
image (task1 matches.jpg) in the report. (1pt)
5. Warp the rst image to the second image using H. The resulting image should contain all
pixels in mountain1.jpg and mountain2.jpg. Include the result image (task1 pano.jpg) in
the report. (1pt)
