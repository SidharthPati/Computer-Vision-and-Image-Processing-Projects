Image Features and Homography
1. Given two images mountain1.jpg and mountain2.jpg, extract SIFT features and draw the keypoints for both images.
2. Match the keypoints using k-nearest neighbour (k=2), i.e., for a keypoint in the left image,finding the best 2 matches in the right image. Filter good matches satisfy m.distance < 0.75 n.distance, where m is the first match and n is the second match. Draw the match image using cv2.drawMatches for all matches (your match image should contain both inliers and outliers).
3. Compute the homography matrix H (with RANSAC) from the first image to the second image.
4. Draw the match image for around 10 random matches using only inliers.
5. Warp the first image to the second image using H. The resulting image should contain all pixels in mountain1.jpg and mountain2.jpg.
